DONE:
+ parse JavaScript
+ normalize with JS_WALA
+ integrate CVC4 constraint system
+ visitor for traversing JS_WALA statements
+ generate constraints for set-based analysis
  + functions, variables
  + objects with computed properties
  + constructors, receivers, global this
  + Arrays
+ create points-to/call graph
+ add effect system on top of call graph
+ more tests for receiver/this
+ more tests for S0 property

TODO:
- editor integration
- macros for desugaring JavaScript with effect contracts

FUTURE:
- meta-programming:
  - "arguments"
  - call/apply
- add support for getters/setters
- add data flow constraints from throw to catch
- add support for prototypical inheritance
