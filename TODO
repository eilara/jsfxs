DONE:
+ Parse JavaScript
+ Normalize with JS_WALA
+ Integrate CVC4 constraint system
+ Visitor for traversing JS_WALA statements

TODO:
- Generate constraints for set-based analysis
  + Functions, variables
  + Objects with computed properties
  + Constructors, receivers, global this
  + Arrays
- Create points-to/call graph
- Add effect system on top of call graph

FUTURE:
- meta-programming:
  - "arguments"
  - call/apply
- Add support for getters/setters
- Add data flow constraints from throw to catch
- Add support for prototypical inheritance
